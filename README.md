## üç¥ Forking this repository

This repository posesses a BSD-2 Clause License, which means **yes**, you can fork and mimic this repository to your worlds desires.  However, attribution would be nice if you are to use this for your own personal website.

The general style and design was inspired by [Brittany Chiang's](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4) portfolio website (shoutout to her), and the React setup with Bootstrap navigation was inspired by [Garrett Love's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxSITxL2JbF229OGCqieVZw) videos.  And there is me, adding my own flare to these concepts.
